# Product API

## Running the application

The application is a MVC/WebAPI 2 app written in c#. The app can be run in debug mode using visual studio.

The application features a simple UI layer to access the API as it's homepage

### Product EndPoints

The endpoints are documented in detail at **/help**

## Running tests

The applications has good coverage of NUnit tests for both the Product Service and API Endpoints. These can be run through the Visual Studio test runner.

## Authentication

Any endpoints that manipulate data (POST, PUT, DELETE) require a user to be authenticated. Authentication is handled by Token Based Authentication to better support API integration.

### Generating Tokens

Tokens can be generated by sending a POST request to **/token** with the following data
`{ header: { "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" }, body: "grant_type=password&username=user&password=pass" }`
This will return an Auth token with an expiry date of one day that can then be used to authenticate future requests.

Tokens can also be generated through the UI by using the login box on the header. This will save the token to a hidden field for subsequent requests.

For testing the credentials are:
admin Adm!NP%Ss

### Using Tokens

Once generated a token will be valid for one day. To authenticate send the following header with each request:
`Authorization: "bearer TOKENHERE"`
